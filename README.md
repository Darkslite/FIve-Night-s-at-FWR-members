Hi, I am the creator of this game.

Sadly I could not convert the .py file into an .exe file so there is a few extra steps you will need if you want to play this game.

- First of all, download all the files and put them into a folder.
- Then install python and visual studio code (here is a video to help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUAK4x_7thA)
- Then install the pygame extension, by typing: "pip install pygame" in the comman prompt (if this would not work, just search up a video on youtube)
- Finally open visual studio code and open the "Five_Night's_at_FWR_members.py" file and click Run and debug (should be on the top right corner)

I will try to convert the game to a .exe file but there appears to be some issues on my pc that have to be fixed.

Regards, I hope you enjoy the game
